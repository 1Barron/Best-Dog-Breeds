<p1>These dogs are extremely good with children and have a strong desire to please their owners. In addition they look adorable with their large ears, short stature, and long torso. Pembroke Welsh Corgis live 12-14 years and are loved by royal families. If Queen Elizabeth II loved theses dogs why shouldn't you?</p1>
  
<h1>#2 Siberian Husky</h1>

<p1>Huskies are known to be one of if not the most beautiful dogs in the world with their thick coats and blue eyes. Like the corgi, they are good with children. Huskies don't shed much except for 2 times during the year. In addition, they live for 10-15 years abd don't have that weird dog smell like most other dog species.</p>
